    - "Dark-minded man!"
    The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
    Brings with itself an ample recompense.
    I have not reared the oriflamme of death â€”
    Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
    Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
    Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
    To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
    Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
    Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
    To England friendly as to all the world;
    Only to those an enemy, whose lust
    Of sway makes them the enemies of man."
