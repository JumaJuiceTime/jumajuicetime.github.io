# Bronze Age Conversion
The typical pieces of a panoply only accomodate for 6 pieces. The gambeson has no direct analogue, armor was placed over a tunic. A cuirass wasn't worn over a linothorax, unlike a breastplate being worn over a mail shirt. A cuirass doesn't directly outclass a linothorax. A solution to the missing 7th piece, the rule of cool allows a cuirass to be +2 armor.
