# Marovingian Gaul/France Setting

- Post collapse atop the ruins of the mighty western Roman empire
- Points of light
- Resilient society holding on to elements of the past
- Not feudal
- Organic social mobility

## Landscape
- Pagi: Rural districts
- Civitas: multiple pagi, an urban central space and the territory around it. ie counties in the western US
    - The civitas was a primary focus of identity
    - Civitas life continued apace, even in the wake of western rome's fall

## Government
When kings & princes hold territory functionally they control appointment of administrators for the civitas and gain tax revenue and military recruitment.
- Count: oversees civitate
- Duke: oversees a region containing multiple civitates


## The Church

### Heirarchy
- Pagi: Little parish churches report to bishops in civitates
- Civitates: Bishops oversee the parish churches of the pagi
    - In most cases the bishop's cathedral seat was synonymous with the civitate's capital
- Province: Metropolitan bishop (Archbishop) oversee the management of the church within the province

- Ecclesiastical networks kept communication open between civitates

Kings gaining "new" civitates would lead to bishops overseeing flocks reporting to different kings. This could lead to the creation of new chains of command.

Kings worried that bishops would betray them, usually unnecessarily.
Counts would attack, imprison, or exile suspected bishops.
