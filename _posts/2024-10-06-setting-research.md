# Rome
Rome has no rules regarding succession. Numerous civil wars have followed the death of an emperor, or an upstart claiming to be emperor of the empire or a portion of it. Many emperors came from lowly birth, swine hand or slave-soldier.

Roman legions were often funded by their commander.

Romans dismantled pagan(old) temples to reuse the stone in new buildings.

Commoners: Scholar-officials, peasants, laborers, merchants

Local autonomous dynastic domains were established by the emperor allocating land to a noble & allowing the title & fief to be legitimately inherited.

## Heaven Worship
Zhou emperors had "the mandate of heaven" the ruler, the son of heaven, was bestowed the mandate by heaven, if they are virtuous. If overthrown they were interpreted to be unworthy. Natural disasters were "due" to the mandate being withdrawn. This would lead to revolts. Heaven is the highest power. Ancestors and gods are seen as a medium between heaven and man.
