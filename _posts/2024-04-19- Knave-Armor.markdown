# Bronze Age Conversion
The typical pieces of a panoply only accomodate for 5 pieces of armor. The gambeson has no direct analogue, armor was placed over a tunic. A cuirass wasn't worn over a linothorax, unlike a breastplate being worn over a mail shirt. A cuirass doesn't directly outclass a linothorax. A solution to the missing element of Knave's 7 piece set: The linothorax provides +2 AP and uses 2 slots. The rule of cool allows a cuirass to be +3 armor and use 3 slots.
