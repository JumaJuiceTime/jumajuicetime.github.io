# 1 Great story
Wod & Daitis rule from the great world tree. The fey execute a plot to overthrow the king and queen. Wod & Daitis are killed and their 3 daughters are exiled.
Tersa wanders the world for many years, until she meets Oktos. He takes her in and they create a life together. Many years later their children Jul and Margon are reached out to by Sepele and Apera, which sets in motion the reclamation of the kingdom. 
The fey are banished. The Children of Wod & Daitis split their birthright. Tersa takes the throne and controls the earth. Sepele becomes the guardian of gateways and the death/life cycle. Apera becomes the keeper of magic and secrets.

- Sepele's husband's death steers her to her domain.
- Apera becomes split/ a duo when they become moons-blessed.


Dael Kingsmill, in a video on pantheons, proposes that 1 great story is what you need to create your foundation. 4 roles need fulfilled, Authority, Harbor, Purpose, Treachery.
The below outline places Tersa as authority, Oktos as harbor, Jul & Margon as purpose, and the unnamed fey as treachery.
